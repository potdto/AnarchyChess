# A website designed to implement rules from r/AnarchyChess. Holy hell!
# NOTE: THIS PROJECT IS NOT FINISHED.
This idea basically came from [r/AnarchyChess](reddit.com/r/anarchychess) where users created their own special rules to add into the game. I decided to take it upon myself to try and create an online version where you could play with these rulesets.
If you want to see the project so far, you can click [here](https://anarchy-chess.vercel.app/) to see a live demo.
